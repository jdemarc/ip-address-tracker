# ip-address-tracker

App idea comes from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/)

A small app that allows you to determine a location based on an IP address. By default, it should query your current location.

! This app will not work without a geo.ipify.org key AND a Mapbox access key.  They are not included in the code.
